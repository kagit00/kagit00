# Hi, I'm Kaustav. I build things that scale. 

I’m a Backend Engineer who actually enjoys the "messy" parts of systems—the edge cases, and the race conditions. My focus is on Java and high-throughput architectures, but my real job is turning ambiguous ideas into reliable, production-ready reality.

I believe good engineering isn't just about writing code; it’s about making sure that code survives contact with the real world.

##  What I’m Thinking About Lately

* **Reliability at Scale:** Building systems that don't just work, but stay working when traffic hits.
* **The "Data Deluge":** Crafting event-driven pipelines that ingest and process data without breaking a sweat.
* **Performance Trade-offs:** I'm obsessed with the balance between latency, correctness, and cost.

##  What I’ve Built

### 🔹 ScheduleX — A Matching Engine with Brains

Imagine trying to match millions of entities without the system grinding to a halt. I built ScheduleX to solve exactly that.

* **The Challenge:** Moving past  complexity.
* **The Win:** Used **Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH)** to generate 7M+ matches and implemented **off-heap storage** to keep the memory happy and memory pressure low.

### 🔹 FlairBit — Scaling Social Connections

A "Reels-first" dating platform where the UX has to feel instant, even if the backend is doing heavy lifting.

* **The Win:** I separated real-time workflows from batch processing using an event-driven design, cutting latency by about **40%**. I also leaned on the **Outbox Pattern** to make sure no message (or match) ever got lost in the shuffle.

##  My Journey So Far

**Software Developer @ TechBulls SoftTech**
I spent my time here in the high-stakes world of financial APIs. I learned that when you're dealing with RBI standards and FCC screening, "close enough" isn't an option. I managed to squeeze **25% more performance** out of our systems through iterative profiling—turns out, small tweaks in the right places go a long way.

##  My Engineering Philosophy

* **Simplicity is a feature.** If a system is too clever to understand, it’s too hard to maintain.
* **Measure twice, optimize once.** I don't guess where the bottleneck is; I look at the metrics.
* **Build for the next person.** I write code assuming the person maintaining it might be me in six months (and I’ll want to like that guy).

##  Let’s Chat

Whether it’s about system design, Java internals, or why my LeetCode graph looks the way it does, I'm always down to talk shop.
